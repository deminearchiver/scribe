# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 23 January 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how deminearchiver ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and shares information about users ("you") of the Scribe application ("Scribe," "app," "service").

**1. Information We Collect**

We collect the following types of information:

*   **Account Information:** When you create a Scribe account, we collect your username and you may choose to provide an avatar image. You will also be asked for an email when creating an account, and optionally you may provide your name. This information is necessary to identify you within the service and allow you to access your data.
*   **Content Information:** Scribe allows you to create and store notes. The content of your notes, including any text, is stored on our cloud servers.
*   **Asset Information:** You may attach files ("Assets"), such as images, videos, or audio files, to your notes. These Assets are automatically uploaded to and stored on our cloud servers. You may choose to upload an asset to the cloud even when attaching it via a direct link.
*   **Usage Information:** We may collect information about how you use Scribe, such as the features you use, the actions you take, and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. This helps us improve the app and provide a better user experience.
*   **Device Information:** We may collect information about the device you use to access Scribe, such as the device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers. This helps us with troubleshooting and optimizing the app for different platforms.
*   **Third-Party Authentication:** If you choose to sign up or log in to Scribe using a third-party service (e.g., Google, Apple, Notion, GitHub), we will receive certain information from that service as permitted by your privacy settings with that service. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use your information for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain Scribe:** We use your information to create and manage your account, store your notes and Assets, and enable you to access and use the features of Scribe.
*   **To Improve Scribe:** We use your information to analyze app usage, understand user preferences, develop new features, and improve the overall user experience.
*   **To Communicate with You:** We may use your information to send you service-related announcements, updates, security alerts, and support messages.
*   **To Ensure Security:** We use your information to protect the security and integrity of Scribe, detect and prevent fraud, and enforce our Terms of Use.

**3. How We Share Your Information**

*   **Public Information:** Your username and avatar image are publicly visible to other Scribe users.
*   **Shared Notes:** If you choose to share a note via a public link, the content of that note, including any Assets attached to it, will be accessible to anyone who has the link. The note will be visible at its current and future states to anyone with the link.
*   **Service Providers:** We may share your information with third-party service providers who assist us in providing and maintaining Scribe, such as cloud storage providers, database management services, and analytics providers. These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and only use it for the purposes we specify.
*   **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose your information if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, court order, or other legal process. We may also disclose your information if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Scribe, our users, or others.
*   **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice within Scribe of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.

**4. Data Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

**5. Data Retention**

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Scribe. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**6. Your Choices**

*   **Account Information:** You can update your account information at any time by accessing your account settings within Scribe.
*   **Shared Notes:** You can control the sharing settings for each of your notes.
*   **Third-Party Authentication:** You can disconnect your Scribe account from third-party authentication services by adjusting your settings within Scribe or the third-party service.

**7. Children's Privacy**

Scribe is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

**8. Third-Party Authentication**

We do not control and are not responsible for how third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, Apple, Notion, GitHub) handle your data. We strongly recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of these third-party providers before using them to authenticate with Scribe.

**9. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within Scribe and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of Scribe after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
